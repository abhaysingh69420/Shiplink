## 🌟 The Vision
Traditional courier services are built for corporations, not students. **ShipLink** bridges the gap by connecting international students who need to send parcels with verified peers who have extra luggage space. We turn empty suitcases into a community-powered logistics network.

## 🔍 Research & Problem Definition
Our team didn't just design an app; we engineered a solution based on rigorous academic research methodologies.

### 1. The Root Cause (Ishikawa Diagram)
We used the **Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram** to identify why students struggle with international shipping. Key categories analyzed:
- **Environment:** Customs regulations and long waiting times.
- **Methods:** Chaotic Telegram/WhatsApp groups with zero accountability.
- **People:** Lack of trust when meeting strangers.
- **Costs:** High air cargo charges (€70–€90 for small items).

### 2. Strategic Assessment (SWOT)
- **Strengths:** 10x cheaper than DHL/FedEx; built-in HSRW student network.
- **Weaknesses:** Building trust for first-time users.
- **Opportunities:** Expansion to all major German "Uni-Cities."
- **Threats:** Complex customs laws (addressed in our Legal/Docs feature).

### 3. User Personas (Target Audience)
| Persona | Background | Goal | Pain Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sara (Iran)** | Master's in Usability | Send gifts home safely | High courier costs |
| **Arman (Iran)** | Computer Science | Receive documents from Iran | Slow delivery speed |
| **Rohan (India)** | Engineering | Share cultural snacks/gifts | Chaotic group chats |

## ✨ The High-Fidelity Ecosystem
Our final product solves three fundamental pillars of P2P logistics:

### 🛡️ Multi-Layered Trust Architecture
- **Verification Flow:** A seamless, story-style stepper requiring Student ID and Liveness checks to ensure every user is a real student.
- **Mutual Proof:** Integration of "Mutual Connections" badges so users know who they can trust within the university community.

### 💳 Secure Escrow Payment Gateway
- **Zero-Anxiety Finance:** Funds are held in a secure ShipLink Escrow.
- **Status Visibility:** A persistent "🔒 Funds Secured" banner in the chat ensures the traveler knows they'll be paid, and the sender knows their money is safe until delivery.

### 🤝 Physical-to-Digital Handover (QR)
- **Verifiable Pickup:** At the moment of meeting, a unique QR code scan triggers the handover confirmation.
- **Live Tracking:** High-fidelity Map integration showing real-time location updates for parcels in transit.

## 📈 Project Management & Execution
We followed a strict **Agile/Lean (Kaizen)** philosophy to ensure continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

- **Gantt Chart:** Used for meticulous time-planning of Research, Low-Fi, and High-Fi phases.
- **User Testing:** Conducted two rounds of testing. Round 2 findings directly informed our Escrow and Handover UI updates.
- **Interface Management:** Ensuring 100% data transparency between Sender, Traveler, and Receiver.
